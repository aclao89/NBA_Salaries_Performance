## Introduction

This project explores the correlation between NBA player salaries and actual on-court performance from both 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons.

The purpose is to identify above average performers with below average salary (in per minute terms) whom are about to free agents in the subsequent off-season. This analysis provides insights and opportunities to add quality rotational players to compete for a NBA Finals run.

For performance, we will use a metric called [Approximate Value (AV)](https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/approximate-value/), developed by Dean Oliver. AV estimates a player's values, making no fine distinctions, but, rather, distinguishing easily between very good seasons, average seasons, and poor seasons.

Bonus: We can also identify which players are overpaid and underpaid based on salary and performance.
